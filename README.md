# Typhon Station

Typhon Station is a browser-based sci-fi adventure game, in the style of Dragon Tavern. Players create a pilot, choose a ship, then go off to shoot things and take their money.

## API and Schema

See the [typhon backend](https://github.com/marcmajcher/typhon-be/blob/master/README.md) for current info.

## Testing

Make sure the backend is up and running (locally, for now), and start up Cypress with ```npm run e2e```.
